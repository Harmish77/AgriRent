        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>Welcome to AgriRent! By using our website to rent equipment or buy farm supplies, you agree to these terms. If you don’t agree, please don’t use the site.</p>

        <h2>Your Info</h2>
        <p>Please provide true and accurate details when signing up or making transactions.</p>

        <h2>Use of Equipment</h2>
        <p>Renters should use the equipment responsibly and return it on time in good condition.</p>

        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>You will see all prices upfront and should pay before using the service. Refunds or cancellations depend on individual cases.</p>

        <h2>Our Role</h2>
        <p>AgriRent is a platform connecting users and equipment owners or suppliers — we don’t own the equipment or products ourselves. We’re not responsible for issues between users but will help where we can.</p>
